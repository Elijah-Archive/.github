Elijah's Archive
What this archive is

This GitHub organization is a historical portfolio of projects I built over the past several years.
Each repo here represents a stage in my learning, experimentation, and prototyping journey.

The projects cover a wide range of domains:

🤖 AI Assistants – conversational voice-controlled agents with function calling and TTS/STT.

🚁 Drone Systems – manual keyboard pilots, computer vision experiments, and aerial face recognition prototypes.

🦾 Robotics & Hardware – Arduino-based servo/flex sensor builds, robotic hand control.

🎬 Media/Post-Production Tools – Baselight/Xytech reconciliation with automated Excel/thumbnail reports.

Why archive?

Rather than lose these projects to old drives and forgotten folders, I’ve archived them here to:

📜 Preserve the work I’ve done and the skills I built along the way.

🎓 Showcase progression from early scripts to larger, multi-file systems.

🔍 Demonstrate breadth — Python, C++ (Arduino), SQLite, OpenCV, robotics, AI APIs, and more.

What to expect

Each repo includes:

A README explaining the project purpose and setup.

A note on when it was originally built (so context isn’t lost).

Minimal setup instructions to reproduce or understand the prototype.

A status flag (Archived) — these are not actively maintained, but preserved as reference.
